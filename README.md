# Patient-_Case-_Similarity
This project identifies similar patient cases based on medical reports and symptoms, aiming to improve patient outcomes, aid treatment recommendations, and support clinical decision-making. By leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, the system finds and retrieves the most relevant cases for a given query.
